## Front-end Web Developer Skills Test

In this scenario you have been tasked with creating a landing page, a login page, and a mock administrator dashboard for a company specializing in Social Media CRM.

Note: The main purpose of this exercise is to help us gauge the extent of your desin and coding skills, which means that content is only a secondary concern (feel free to use lorem ipsum for headers and other content).

Provide is a link to a GitHub Repository which includes the project file structure, required images, and a palette for the website.

First, you must create a local clone of the repository provide above using git (git bash). Once you have pulled the files, you must load the project into your IDE of choice (Atom and VS Code are provided). You will create a Landing page using the images provided, which will redirect the user to a login page. This login page will then redirect the user to a dashboard. All of the pages created for this website must be mobile responsive, use the provided palette and images found in the "images" folder. This is an open-internet exercise which means you're allowed to use any additional front-end frameworks or libraries (Bootstrap, jQuery, etc...) as you see fit. Once you've finished making the mock website you will stage, commit and push your changes to the remote repository. You will have 50 minutes to complete this task. Once all these steps have been completed you will give a brief showcase of your final deliverable.

If you have any questions during this examination, please let me know.
